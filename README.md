**Production-ready tool for running AI coding agents in parallel on your codebase**

Codex Worker enables safe, resumable, parallel execution of AI coding agents (Codex, Gemini) on multiple files. It's designed for "vibe coding" - where you describe tasks in markdown files and let AI agents implement them in parallel.

## üéØ Why Codex Worker?

When working with AI coding agents, you often want to:
- **Process multiple tasks in parallel** - Run 10 agents fixing different bugs simultaneously
- **Resume after interruptions** - Power outage? Network issue? Just run again, completed tasks are skipped
- **Track progress visually** - See what's done, in-progress, or failed at a glance
- **Maintain safety** - Default read-only mode, explicit permissions for modifications
- **Coordinate multiple workers** - Run from multiple terminals without conflicts

## üöÄ Key Features

### üìÅ File Prefix State Management

Codex Worker uses a simple but powerful approach: file prefixes track state.

```
tasks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fix-auth-bug.md                 # ‚è∏Ô∏è  Pending task
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ in-progress-add-feature.md      # üîÑ Currently being processed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ done_exec_log-update-api.md.txt # ‚úÖ Completed task (with output log)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ failed_exec_log-refactor.md.txt # ‚ùå Failed task (with error log)
```

This prefix system enables:
- **Zero-config resumability** - Just run the command again
- **Parallel coordination** - Workers see what others are doing
- **Clear visual status** - `ls` shows you everything
- **No database needed** - Filesystem is the source of truth

### üîÑ Perfect Resumability

Interrupted? No problem. Codex Worker automatically:
1. Skips completed tasks (files with `done_exec_log-` prefix)
2. Detects in-progress tasks from other workers
3. Cleans up stale locks from crashed processes
4. Retries failed tasks based on your configuration

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install codex-worker

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codex-worker
cd codex-worker
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `codex` CLI or `gemini` CLI installed
- Typer, Rich (installed automatically)

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Basic: Process All Tasks in Current Directory

```bash
# Create task files
echo "Fix the authentication bug in login.py" > fix-auth.md
echo "Add rate limiting to API endpoints" > add-ratelimit.md
echo "Refactor database queries for performance" > optimize-db.md

# Run Codex on all .md files (safe read-only mode by default)
codex-worker

# Output:
# ‚úÖ fix-auth.md completed
# ‚úÖ add-ratelimit.md completed  
# ‚úÖ optimize-db.md completed
```

### Parallel Execution: Speed Up with Multiple Workers

```bash
# Run 4 AI agents in parallel
codex-worker --concurrency 4

# Each agent works on a different file simultaneously
# 4x faster than sequential execution!
```

### Resume After Interruption

```bash
# Start processing 100 files
codex-worker large-tasks/ --concurrency 8

# Ctrl+C after 30 files complete
# ^C Shutting down gracefully...

# Run again - only processes remaining 70 files!
codex-worker large-tasks/ --concurrency 8
# Automatically skips the 30 completed files
```

### Different AI Engines

```bash
# Use Gemini instead of Codex
codex-worker --engine gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash

# Use a specific Codex model
codex-worker --engine codex --model o4

# Mix and match in different directories
codex-worker simple-tasks/ --engine gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash
codex-worker complex-tasks/ --engine codex --model o4
```

### Safety Modes

```bash
# Dry run - see what would be executed
codex-worker --mode dry-run

# Read-only (default) - agent can only read files
codex-worker --mode read-only

# Workspace write - agent can modify files in current directory
codex-worker --mode workspace-write

# Full access (DANGEROUS) - agent can modify any file
codex-worker --mode danger-full-access --yes
```

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check status of all tasks
codex-worker status

# Output:
# ‚îè‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î≥‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î≥‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îì
# ‚îÉ Status      ‚îÉ Count ‚îÉ Percentage ‚îÉ
# ‚î°‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚ïá‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚ïá‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚î´
# ‚îÇ Pending     ‚îÇ    45 ‚îÇ      45.0% ‚îÇ
# ‚îÇ In Progress ‚îÇ     5 ‚îÇ       5.0% ‚îÇ
# ‚îÇ Completed   ‚îÇ    40 ‚îÇ      40.0% ‚îÇ
# ‚îÇ Failed      ‚îÇ    10 ‚îÇ      10.0% ‚îÇ
# ‚îÇ Total       ‚îÇ   100 ‚îÇ     100.0% ‚îÇ
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

# Detailed file-by-file status
codex-worker status --detailed
```

### Clean Up and Reset

```bash
# Clean stale in-progress markers (process died)
codex-worker clean --max-age 3600

# Reset all states to rerun tasks
codex-worker reset --force
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### How It Works

1. **Task Discovery**: Finds all matching files (e.g., `*.md`)
2. **State Check**: Checks file prefixes to determine status
3. **Lock Acquisition**: Atomically acquires lock with `in-progress-` prefix
4. **Execution**: Runs AI agent with configured settings
5. **State Update**: Updates prefix to `done_exec_log-` or `failed_exec_log-`
6. **Parallel Coordination**: Multiple workers respect each other's locks

### File Prefix Convention

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| (none) | Pending task | `fix-bug.md` |
| `in-progress-` | Currently processing | `in-progress-fix-bug.md` |
| `done_exec_log-` | Successfully completed | `done_exec_log-fix-bug.md.txt` |
| `failed_exec_log-` | Failed execution | `failed_exec_log-fix-bug.md.txt` |
| `.lock-` | Temporary lock file | `.lock-fix-bug.md` |

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Read-only by default** - Must explicitly enable write access
- **Confirmation prompts** - For dangerous operations
- **Atomic operations** - No partial states or race conditions
- **Process monitoring** - Detects and cleans up dead processes
- **Graceful shutdown** - Ctrl+C handled properly
- **Comprehensive validation** - All inputs validated with Typer

## üéØ Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Parallel Bug Fixes
```bash
# Create bug report files
for i in {1..20}; do
  echo "Fix bug #$i: Check the error in module$i.py" > bug-$i.md
done

# Fix all bugs in parallel with 5 workers
codex-worker bug-*.md --concurrency 5 --mode workspace-write
```

### 2. Code Review Automation
```bash
# Generate review tasks for each PR file
git diff main --name-only | while read file; do
  echo "Review and suggest improvements for $file" > review-$(basename $file).md
done

# Run reviews in parallel
codex-worker review-*.md --concurrency 10
```

### 3. Test Generation
```bash
# Create test generation tasks
find src -name "*.py" | while read file; do
  echo "Generate comprehensive tests for $file" > test-$(basename $file).md
done

# Generate all tests
codex-worker test-*.md --concurrency 8 --mode workspace-write
```

### 4. Documentation Updates
```bash
# Create doc tasks
echo "Update README with new API endpoints" > doc-api.md
echo "Add examples to authentication guide" > doc-auth.md
echo "Document the new CLI commands" > doc-cli.md

# Process documentation updates
codex-worker doc-*.md --concurrency 3
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
export CODEX_CMD=/path/to/codex     # Custom codex binary
export GEMINI_CMD=/path/to/gemini   # Custom gemini binary
```

### Command Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--pattern` | File pattern to match | `*.md` |
| `--engine` | AI engine (codex/gemini) | `codex` |
| `--model` | Model name | `o4-mini` |
| `--mode` | Safety level | `read-only` |
| `--concurrency` | Parallel workers | `1` |
| `--timeout` | Task timeout (seconds) | None |
| `--retries` | Retry attempts | `0` |
| `--approval` | Human approval mode | `on-request` |

## üìä Performance Tips

1. **Optimal Concurrency**: Usually 4-8 workers gives best results
2. **File Organization**: Group similar tasks in directories
3. **Task Granularity**: Smaller, focused tasks work better
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Watch CPU/memory with high concurrency

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Stale Locks
```bash
# If workers crash, clean up stale locks
codex-worker clean --max-age 3600
```

### Reset Everything
```bash
# Remove all state markers and start fresh
codex-worker reset --force
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# See detailed execution information
codex-worker --verbose tasks/
```
